        This is a function written specifically for our 1852 depth fix.
        We make use of the fault points used in generating our prior as
        jumping off point for fixing the depth of an event. We use a
        simple trig correction based on a 20degree dip angle and the haversine distance
        to get the depth of the earthquake in question.

        Note, this will do the dip correction regardless of which side
        of the trench our sample is on. Recognizing when the sample is
        on the wrong side seems nontrivial, so we have not implemented
        a check for this here.

        ----------
        longitude(deg) : float
            The longitude position of a specific fault point
